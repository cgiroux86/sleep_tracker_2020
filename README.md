## Sleep_Tracker_2020
Designed to give users ability to easily input information about their sleeping patterns. Through data visualizations and a simple algorithm, users are able view their sleeping patterns and receive feedback on optimal sleeping time. 

## Motivation
While going to Lambda School, I was faced with the connundrum of budgeting my time as effectively as possible. We all know how important sleep is, so I wanted to find the optimal time I could sleep, while still dedicating as many as hours as possible to growing as a Developer. This is a simple application, built in less than a week, but it really helped solidify knowledge of Full Stack Development and helped me thrive in my journey through Lambda School!
